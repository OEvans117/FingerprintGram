# FingerprintGram

This will be for my final year computing project (social media website that collects fingerprints).

Collects the following information

• ScreenInfo

• IsJavaEnabled

• Plugin List

• User Agent

• Browser Permissions

• Navigator Properties

• Canvas Information

• IP Address

Then uses a scoring system to determine the likelihood of a user being repeated.
